Design Rationale
My Modular Media Suite demonstrates how structural design patterns can make a media playback system more flexible, organized, and easy to maintain. Each pattern solves a specific structural problem and helps the components interact in a clear and efficient way. Below, I explain which patterns I used, where they were applied, and why I chose them.

1. Bridge Pattern (MediaPlayer / RenderImplementation)
Problem:
I needed a way to support different types of rendering (for example, software-based and hardware-based) while keeping the main media player independent from the rendering details.

Solution:
I used the Bridge pattern to separate the MediaPlayer abstraction from its concrete rendering implementations (RenderImplementation). This allows both the abstraction and the implementation to evolve independently.

Benefit:
This makes the system easier to extend. I can add new renderers or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the code. The abstraction and implementation communicate through a shared interface, keeping everything consistent and modular.

Implementation:
In my project, the MediaPlayer acts as the refined abstraction that works with different renderers (like SoftwareImplementation or HardwareImplementation) through the common RenderImplementation interface. This setup allows runtime switching between rendering methods via the setImplementation method.

2. Composite Pattern (Playlist / MediaSource)
Problem:
I wanted the system to handle both single media items (like videos or songs) and groups of items (like playlists) in a uniform way.

Solution:
The Composite pattern allows objects to be combined into tree structures, so both individual objects (LocalFileSource, HLSStream) and groups (Playlist) can be treated the same through the MediaSource interface.

Benefit:
This pattern simplifies media management. Whether I’m working with a single file or a playlist containing sub-playlists, I can use the same interface. It also makes the system more scalable and organized.

Implementation:
Both Playlist (the composite) and individual media items (the leaves, like LocalFileSource) implement the same MediaSource interface. This allows a Playlist to contain either media files or other Playlists, all accessed through common operations.

3. Decorator Pattern (MediaDecorator)
Problem:
I needed a way to add extra playback features—like watermarks, subtitles, or an audio equalizer—without changing the original media classes.

Solution:
The Decorator pattern lets me wrap MediaSource objects with additional behaviors at runtime. The MediaDecorator abstract class provides the base for concrete decorators.

Benefit:
This approach keeps the system flexible and supports the Open/Closed Principle: classes are open for extension but closed for modification. I can add or remove features easily without rewriting the base media code.

Implementation:
I used WatermarkDecorator, SubtitleDecorator, and AudioEqualizerDecorator to add functionality to any MediaSource object. These decorators can be layered to provide multiple enhancements, as shown in the PlayDemo.

4. Proxy Pattern (RemoteCacheProxy)
Problem:
Accessing media from remote servers can be slow if the same data is requested repeatedly. I needed a way to improve performance without changing how clients access media sources.

Solution:
The Proxy pattern provides a stand-in object that controls access to another object. RemoteCacheProxy acts as a proxy for another MediaSource.

Benefit:
This allows caching and lazy loading to happen transparently. Users or client classes interact with the same MediaSource interface, but behind the scenes, performance is optimized through caching.

Implementation:
I created a RemoteCacheProxy that sits between the media player and a remote MediaSource. It checks if the requested media is already cached. If it is, it serves it immediately; if not, it fetches it from the remote source and stores it for future use.

5. Adapter Pattern (MediaSourceAdapter)
Problem:
Different media sources (local files, remote APIs, HLS stream) might have incompatible interfaces, making them hard to use uniformly within the system.

Solution:
I used the Adapter pattern to make incompatible media source classes conform to the MediaSource interface.

Benefit:
All media sources can use one interface, removing the need for repeated code. Even legacy or third-party sources can work smoothly, making the system cleaner and easier to maintain or extend.

Implementation:
MediaSourceAdapter wraps legacy or third-party classes and exposes a consistent play() method, making them compatible with the MediaSource interface. Classes like LocalFileSource and RemoteAPI are designed to work seamlessly with this pattern in mind.

Trade-offs and Design Decisions
Lightweight Simulation:
To keep the focus on the design patterns, I used simple System.out.println() statements instead of full media rendering. This demonstrates the pattern interactions clearly without unnecessary technical complexity.

Memory-Based Caching:
The RemoteCacheProxy uses a simple in-memory HashMap to demonstrate how caching can improve performance. It’s efficient enough for the purpose of the demo.

Synchronous Playback:
I kept the playback synchronous to highlight the structure and relationships between components rather than dealing with the complexities of asynchronous execution.

Conclusion
My Modular Media Suite shows how different structural design patterns can work together to create a system that is flexible, reusable, and easy to manage.

Bridge separates what something does from how it’s done.
Composite allows media to be grouped into playlists or sub-playlists.
Decorator adds new features to media without changing the original code.
Proxy improves performance by using caching.
Adapter lets different or older media sources use the same interface.
Together, these patterns demonstrate how thoughtful design decisions can lead to a well-organized and extensible architecture for complex systems like media playback.
